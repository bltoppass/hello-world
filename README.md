# hello-world
getting more comfortable with github (previously just used git bash)
I'm just a student learning to be comfortable in GitHub, my education has taught me the basics of a few languages but not how the 
software development world works
So now I am taking this into my own hands, i am learning advanced material in java and c++ and learning to use github for future 
prospects to see my hard work
if for some reason you are actually reading this, i hope that i can prove myself not be a noob anymore, but a pro.
